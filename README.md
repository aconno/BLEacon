# aconno BLE Library

The BLE Library is used to handle Bluetooth communication between the beacons and the Android
devices.

This Android library depends on the "ekstend" library, which should be removed during future
commits.

The BLEacon library corresponds to the library module and ekstend is a module with the same
name.

This BLEacon library is intended to be used by the BLEDemo project.
